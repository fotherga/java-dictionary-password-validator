== Initial Configuration ==
This has to be called prior to any getInstance() calls.  So, if you're developing a web app, you should call this when your servlet container starts up.  It only needs to be called once, and the default is 2 specials, 2 lower, 2 upper, and 2 numerics.
{{{
    DictionaryPasswordValidator.configure(fill_out_options_here);

 DictionaryPasswordValidator pDV = DictionaryPasswordValidator.getInstance();
 if(pDV.isPasswordDictionaryBased("Pa8!ss9wo4rd2") == true) {
     System.out.println("Password contains a dictionary word!");
 } else {
     System.out.println("Password is valid.");
 }
}}}

{{{
 DictionaryPasswordValidator pDV = DictionaryPasswordValidator.getInstance();
